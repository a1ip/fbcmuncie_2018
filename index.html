            Welcome to the website of First Baptist Church in Muncie, Indiana. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Founded in 1859, First Baptist gives believers an opportunity to be a part of a story that began almost 150 years ago, and will continue for lifetimes to come. With a strong Baptist heritage, First Baptist challenges each member to exercise his/her gifts for the glory of God. Distinctively Christian, centered on the Bible, First Baptist proclaims the reign of God in the Muncie community.
