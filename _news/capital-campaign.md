Update: You have pledged $305,405 for our 3-year campaign. At this time $133,695 has come in. Of that, $3,460 has come in from persons who are supporting the project without a pledge. Thank you so much for supporting this project faithfully. It is amazing what can be done when we have a common project that will sustain our building, hopefully into the future. 
One of the first projects that will be addressed this year is the signage project that will create new exterior and interior signage for the church. You will begin to see that project at work as the summer progresses.
