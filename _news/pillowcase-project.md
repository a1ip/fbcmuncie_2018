Our Pillowcase Project continues this summer with an additional class for A Better Way on **June 11** at **5:30 PM**. YWCA women sew on the 4th Thursday each month from 2:00–4:00, and we will add back our middle schoolers from 10:00–12:00 on the 4th Thursday through the short summer (June 28). If you have cotton fabric or money you would like to donate to this project, please contact  Maryanne Bayer or Dana Davis. We purchase the pillows from IKEA. After all, what good is a pillowcase if you don't have a pillow?
