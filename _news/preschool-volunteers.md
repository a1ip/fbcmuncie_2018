Hi families! We are in need of volunteers to teach in the preschool classroom (both worship hours) during the months of **July** and **August** so that our current teacher, Miss Jenny, can take a much-deserved summer break! We just need a handful of people to take 1 or 2 Sundays to make this happen. Another person will be scheduled with you, and lessons will be provided! This is a fun opportunity to maybe get out of your comfort zone and be a huge blessing to our little ones of FBC! Please contact  Britney Sue or Colleen Massoth  if you're interested in helping out this summer.  Thanks!
