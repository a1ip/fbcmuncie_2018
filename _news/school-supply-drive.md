We are helping *Hearts and Hands United* collect school supplies! They will use these supplies to fill backpacks and hand them out to hundreds of children in our community. This is an amazing charity, and it directly impacts childrenâ€™s lives as they start a new school year. Drop off your donations in the labeled box in the church office. (Some ideas are crayons, pencils, notebook paper, folders, pink erasers, and highlighters.) Thank you!!!
