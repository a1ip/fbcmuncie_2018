**Registration for the July 22 Church Friends Lunch has reached capacity and is now closed.** As a reminder for those registered, the lunch will be picnic-style and will take place after second service. Provided the weather cooperates, activities for kids will include an opportunity to play at the YWCA outdoor playground (parents must supervise their children), bubbles, and sidewalk chalk. **We are looking for a few adults to help clean up after the meal.** If you would be willing to help with this, please contact Julie Davis  . Thanks!
