We hope you've reserved the date for our next FBC Church Friends Lunch: **July 22 after second service**. This time we plan to have lunch picnic-style right here in our FBC shelter house. Mark Flodder will be at the grill and Adult Ministries will provide a few sides to go along with that. We plan to have some fun activities for the kids and something simple to help the rest of us get to know one another better.
We will be able to accommodate the **first 60 people** who sign up for this event, and **registration is open until Friday, July 20**. You may register online at  [by clicking here](http://bit.ly/fbc-july-cfl).  **Please make sure you receive confirmation that your registration is complete**. We have had a couple of people who thought they were registered for previous events but had not completed the process. Your registration should say "complete" in green on the screen, and if your email address is in the church database, you should receive a confirmation email from Planning Center. If you are unsure how to register, please call Julie Davis  . She will be happy to assist you.
