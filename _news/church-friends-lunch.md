**Registration for todayâ€™s Church Friends Lunch has reached capacity and is now closed.** As a reminder for those registered, the lunch will be picnic-style and will take place after second service. Provided the weather cooperates, activities for kids will include an opportunity to play at the YWCA outdoor playground (parents must supervise their children), bubbles, and sidewalk chalk. If you have questions contact Julie Davis  . Thanks!
