Pillowcase opportunities abound in July. On July 9 at 5:30 we hosted the ladies from A Better Way. Our other opportunity is **July 26** from **10:00–12:00** with our middle schoolers and **2:00–4:00** with our YWCA women. We hope FBC ladies can be available to coach another participant or be there to instruct ironing methods to guarantee a neat project. Contact Maryanne Bayer   for more information.
