There are several times you could do a summer outreach: Forward S.T.E.P.S. (formerly OPT and Circles) dinners on Thursday evenings, back-to-school backpack project at the Fairgrounds on July 28, assisting YWCA women by bringing clothing and toiletries to the basket marked in the church office, Blood and Fire Ministry meals on late Saturday afternoons. It would be our hope that you would choose one place that you will make a difference in the neighborhood. Watch the bulletins and e-mail for more info.
