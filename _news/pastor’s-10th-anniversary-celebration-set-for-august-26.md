By Molly Flodder, Moderator
Only three of our pastors in 159 years have been with us ten years or longer. Pastor Wade Allen is one of them.
The Church Coordination Team (CCT) decided earlier this year to celebrate this milestone and appreciate Wade and his family while looking back at the transformative decade in the life of our church. The beginning of Wade’s pastorate here was August 28, 2008, so we are celebrating the event on **Sunday, August 26**.
On that Sunday, we will have a **combined service** at **10:45 AM** with special music and a brief historical look at the decade. In keeping with Wade’s series on the Holy Spirit, Wade will share personal reflections of his family’s call to come to First Baptist Church, Muncie. Members of the original search committee will also share how God was leading our church to make that call to the Allen family.
We will also present Wade and his family with a special gift designated by the CCT.
Church will be followed by an all-church lunch in the Lower Auditorium featuring pulled pork and pulled turkey and all the trimmings, most of which are favorites of Wade’s.
There will be opportunity to see lots of pictures from the past ten years of people, events, and activities in our church.
Here is how you can help:
- Contribute to a gift we are making by writing a short thank-you note to Wade and his family. Doing this in your handwriting would be ideal. Mention a memory or a special appreciation that you have. Hand these notes to Michelle Martin or any member of the team (listed below) anytime before the Sunday of the event. If you prefer scanning and emailing your note, send it to \texttt{magandaphotos@gmail.com}. 
- Bring photos that you have of church-related events and people. Give prints to anyone on the committee or email digital photos to Michelle Martin or Roger Morency.   Their emails are \texttt{magandaphotos@gmail.com} and \texttt{roger.morency@gmail.com}. 
- Volunteer to help the kitchen crew set up for or clean up from the special meal. Pray that this recognition will be a magnificent celebration for all of us!
Many thanks to the team that is coordinating this anniversary event. They are: Barb Campbell, Ray Conley, Clif Davis, Bill Eidson, Adam Fink, Mark Flodder, Molly Flodder, Michelle Martin, Roger Morency, and Nina Oisten.
