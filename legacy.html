				<h3>Legacy Campaign</h3>
				<p>
					In 2017, {{site.name}} began a stewardship campaign focused on building improvements. Our {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:1929 }} year old building is in need of a few improvements and we hope that this campaign will allow our building to continue to be used to serve our church family and our community.

        <p>We are well on our way to our goal. With {{ site.pledged }} pledged, we have now collected {{ site.collected }}. Thank you ever so much for supporting this project faithfully. It is amazing what can be done when we have a common project that will sustain our building, hopefully into the future.</p>
