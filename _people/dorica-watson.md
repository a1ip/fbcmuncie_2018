In addition, she is a national trainer for Circles, helping many other communities in the same work and speaking locally in a variety of settings.  She is especially passionate about encouraging people to build relationships with others.
 
Dorica, a Muncie native, holds a Bachelor’s of Social Work degree from Ball State University and serves on the Social Work Advisory Committee there.  She is active in a number of community organizations, including Hearts and Hands, one of the summer service projects FBC members can do to help kids get ready to go back to school. When she is not busy in the community, she enjoys her husband, her three children, extended family and friends.
