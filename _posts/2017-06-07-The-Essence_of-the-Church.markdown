Building, Community, and Presence are rooted in the present (the needs of our community and places where we see God working), in the past (history and tradition), and in the future (imagining life under the rule of Jesus the King). This week we’re going to look at the first church which was formed through the work of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. Immediately some 3,000 people became “the church." What were the markers, the signifiers, the practices of this community? Those are questions we will be looking at this week in our time together at FBC. The years I have spent in ministry have involved both responding to the needs of the present and also trying to help our church community, sometimes successfully, return to the essence of the church which began forming in Acts 2. The church under the leadership of Jesus Christ is always reflecting the characteristics of the formation of the church as they serve as a road map for our present and future. Looking forward to our time together.
