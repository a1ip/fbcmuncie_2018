Last week, we toured Solomon's temple. It was an impressive structure that was certainly impressive for ancient times. The amount of stone, gold and wood used were remarkable. We also know that it took 7 years to build the temple (1 Kings 6:38). Yet as we flip over to chapter 7, the first words tip us off to a problem.

>(1 Kings 7:1 NIV11-GK) It took Solomon thirteen years, however, to complete the construction of his palace.

Certainly, Solomon committed tremendous resources to the temple. Yet he seems to put nearly double the resources into another project: his house. The language used in verse 1 is comparative language. While Solomon was dedicated to the temple project, he seems more concerned with the palace project.

Join us on Sunday as we explore this dynamic. We will tour Solomon's palace and consider the implications of this description. Perhaps this brief statement in verse 1 is indicative of future dynamics in Solomon's kingdom. Perhaps you would read 1 Kings 7:2-12 as you prepare for worship on Sunday.
