On Sunday, we stepped into the season of Epiphany. We ventured with the Magi to the home of Mary and Joseph. They presented gifts to the new king. Their search ended in the home of a humble carpenter. I am not sure they expected this sort of ending to their journey. Yet they experienced God in the unpredictable. 

For the next 30 years, Jesus seems to live in the somewhat ordinary. Luke gives us a few glimpses into Jesus' life during this period of time. On one trip to Jerusalem, his parents loose track of him. After a three day search, they find him discussing advanced topics with the religious leaders. Jesus' explanation give us a clue of his identity.

>(Luke 2:49 NIV11-GK) “Why were you searching for me?” he asked. “Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?”

As we flip over to Luke 3, we fast forward nearly two decades. Jesus begins his ministry by coming to the waters of baptism. The scene at the Jordan River informs our understanding of Jesus' mission. Join us on Sunday as we explore the significance of this encounter. We will find practical application for our lives today as we explore the words of John the Baptist and dramatic scene of Jesus' baptism in Luke 3.

As you prepare for Sunday, you can read Luke 3:15-22.
