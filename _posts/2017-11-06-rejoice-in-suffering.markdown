This week, in our study over 1 Peter, we will continue to explore the issue of suffering. This is not a topic we enjoy. Yet is central to context of the first century and the teachings of scripture. Christians in Peter's time were dealing with persecution. It was not easy to be a Christian in this day. Peter is straightforward,

>(1 Peter 4:12-13 NIV) Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ ...

This is a hard concept to grasp. How can we rejoice in suffering? We often run from suffering or at least do our best to avoid it. Yet there is a promise in this passage. As we suffer, we are told that God's Spirit *rests on us*.

>(1 Peter 4:14 NIV) If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.

Join us on Sunday as we engage 1 Peter 4:12-19. While suffering is not something we pursue, when it comes as a result of our faith, we can rest assured that God will give us all that we need to endure.
