Have you made a hurtful comment? Maybe you wished you could retrieve the words and place them back in your mouth. We know it doesn't work that way. Once words are spoken, they cannot be recovered. They somehow flow from our mouths and have immense power to destroy. In this week's text, James addresses the power of words (or the tongue). James seems to be addressing teachers in the church. Certainly, destructive teaching can wreak havoc on a congregation. But James' instruction also applies to the words spoken to one another. James likens our tongue to a horse's bit or a ship's rudder.

>(James 3:5 NIV11-GK) “Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts.”

James highlights the fierce nature of the tongue. His words are strong. He describes the tongue.

>(James 3:8 NIV11-GK) “no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.”

Wow! Poison? That seems a bit forceful. Yet most of us have experienced the destruction of irresponsible words. I hope you will join us on Sunday as we explore James 3:1-12. 

Also remember that we set our clocks back this weekend. That means you get an extra hour of sleep. Also, it is the first Sunday of the month which means that we celebrate Communion this week.
