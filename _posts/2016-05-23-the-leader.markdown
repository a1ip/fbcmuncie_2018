It is nearly impossible to recount all of Peter's stories in the bible. In the gospels, he is named more than any other person except for Jesus. If we asked for a list of the twelve, most of you would not miss Peter. We know much about this man.

He is characterized as loud, out-front, impulsive and the first to speak. He asks Jesus lots of questions. He is the only disciple to be called *Satan* by Jesus. He walks on water, speaks at the Transfiguration and tells Jesus that he is wrong about his prediction of denial. Jesus tells his disciples,

>(Matthew 26:31 NIV) Then Jesus told them, "This very night you will all fall away on account of me...

Peter's response is quick,

>(Matthew 26:33 NIV) Peter replied, “Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.”

We know the story. As much as Peter wants to do the right thing, he caves when the pressure is turned on. We might make the case that Peter's failures are as significant as anyone's in the bible. At the same time, his contributions to the kingdom of God are weighty. Peter is all in, all out in terms of his personality. Jesus knows him well and will allow the Holy Spirit to mold Peter's gifts into the type of leader God desires. 

Join us on Sunday as we explore the life of Peter. While it is nearly impossible to cover every aspect of this principal apostle's life, we will consider how his life challenges us in 2016.
