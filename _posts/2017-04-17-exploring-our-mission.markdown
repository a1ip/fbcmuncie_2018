It was wonderful to worship together on Sunday; Easter is certainly a high point on the church calendar. This year, we enjoyed a phenomenal community Good Friday service along with a baby dedication on Easter. This weekend was remarkable.

As we move beyond Easter, we look toward summer. On the church calendar, the Easter season continues until Pentecost Sunday (June 4). Sometimes, we continue to follow the lectionary through this season. Yet given our unique season of summer sabbatical quickly approaching, we will spend the next several weeks preparing for this venture.

Beginning this Sunday (April 23), we will begin a three week series on our mission as a church. We will not talk about the universal calling of all churches. Rather we will look specifically at how God is leading us at First Baptist in Muncie. If you notice our [new website](http://fbcmuncie.org), you will see the headline on our site including three words: Building. Community. Presence.

These are the words that we have discerned as central to our mission in 2017. Over the next several weeks, we will explore these words. We come, this week, to the first word: Building. In many ways, we are defined by our extraordinary building. It is difficult to separate the people of First Baptist Muncie from the structure at 309 East Adams Street. What does this mean for us? In what ways should we consider our building?

Join us on Sunday as we explore this word in relation to who we are at First Baptist Church in Muncie, Indiana. 

As we explore our mission, we will set the stage for a fantastic summer of preaching and outreach. If you have not yet read about all that is happening this summer, let me encourage you to take a look at the [April Visitor](http://visitor.fbcmuncie.org/visitor_2017-04.pdf).
