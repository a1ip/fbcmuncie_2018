The disciples sometimes seem clueless in the Gospel accounts. We find them squabbling over who is the greatest (Luke 22:24). They are sleeping when Jesus needs them the most (Matthew 26:40). And while Jesus predicts his death on a number of occasions, they don't seem to understand. Yet Jesus gently corrects their perceptions about the Kingdom and leads them toward the truth. 

In this Sunday's text, Peter asks Jesus a question about forgiveness. It is an honest question; most Christ-followers would admit the difficultly in this matter. Peter wonders how far we are required go in our forgiveness. There must be a limit.

>(Matthew 18:21 NIV11-GK) “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?”

His question seems reasonable. He even offers a suggestion. How about seven times? Seems like a good number to me.

>(Matthew 18:22 NIV)  Jesus answered, “I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.

Jesus begins to explain his position with a story, a parable. The story is riveting. Join us on Sunday as we explore Matthew 18:21-35 together.
