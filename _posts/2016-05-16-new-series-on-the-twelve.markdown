I woke up this morning excited about this week's sermon work. For months now, I been preparing sermons for our upcoming series on the 12 disciples; we finally get to dive in. On Sunday, we kick off a series that will take us through much of the summer. I hope you will be able to join us as we introduce the series.

How much do you know about the disciples? Can you name all 12? When were they selected to be a part of this special group? How were they introduced to Jesus? What sorts of qualifications did they need to get in? Why did Jesus choose 12? Why not 10 or 15? What role did they play in the early church? Where did they end up? Does the Bible record their deaths? I've been surprised by much of what I have encountered in my preparation; I can't wait to share it with you.

The choosing of the disciples is recorded in Luke 6:12-16. 

>(Luke 6:12-16 NIV) One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God. When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.

We will discuss how and why Jesus chose these men. We will discover a unique group of unlikely characters in this story. They are anything but high-caliber spiritual leaders when chosen. But in time, Jesus will transform them into powerful representatives of the kingdom of God. Join us on Sunday as we begin this journey together.
