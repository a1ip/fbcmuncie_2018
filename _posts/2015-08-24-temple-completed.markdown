We have been talking about the Temple in worship during the month of August. Perhaps you have had enough descriptions on building materials and measurements. These scriptures can seem a bit tedious. Yet they have helped us understand the Temple imagery that we so often see in the New Testament. We come this week to the final August sermon. In this week's text the Temple is dedicated (1 Kings 8:1-9:9).

Solomon gathers dignitaries from all over the kingdom to celebrate the completion of the Temple. He reflects on all that God has accomplished. He praises God for his provision and gives Him the credit for the ornate structure they are dedicating. The priests bring in the ark of the covenant and Solomon offers a prayer for the people. This is certainly a high point for the people of God. At the same time, we sense a dark cloud on the horizon.

As we consider this story from 1 Kings 8:1-9:9, we will reflect on our own tendency to fall from the high points of life. We want to be faithful to God, but too often we gravitate toward our own plans. Join us on Sunday as we continue the story of Solomon.
