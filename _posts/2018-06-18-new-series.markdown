I hope that you enjoyed our recent series over the Ten Commandments. We completed this series this past week and will move into a four-week series in 1 John this week. 

1 John is a tremendous letter. By the time that John pens this letter, he is likely older. He has seen much. He is perhaps the only disciple left. In this letter, he is guiding the early church in their understanding of Jesus’ life and mission. False teachers abound; John is attempting to correct the misconceptions of Jesus and point believers into what it means to live in the Kingdom of God. 

This week, we will be looking at the first four verses of this letter. Let me encourage you to read these verses in preparation for Sunday’s sermon.


>(1 John 1:1-4 NIV) That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched—this we proclaim concerning the Word of life. The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. We write this to make our joy complete.
