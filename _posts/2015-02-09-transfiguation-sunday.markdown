This past Sunday, we talked about light (along with salt). We explored Jesus' admonition to be salt and light in our world. This week, we come to Transfiguration Sunday. It is the last Sunday in the season of Epiphany. The season of Epiphany is about the light of Jesus coming into the world; Transfiguration Sunday highlights the story of Jesus on the mountaintop with Moses and Elijah. Jesus is transformed into a bright white. In fact, Mark tells us that Jesus' clothes turned,

>(Mark 9:3 NIV11-GK) dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them

We have explored the Transfiguration several times in worship. This will not be a repeat of those sermons. Instead, we will briefly explore the story of Mark 9:2-9 and quickly move on to 2 Corinthians 4:3-6. In Paul's second letter to the Corinthians, he speaks of the gospel light shining in a dark world. 

This week, we will explore the image of light once again. Yet we will talk about another image that is sometimes associated with light. The image of a veil is used to describe a covering up of truth. We will explore the story of Moses glowing after spending time with God on a mountain (you can see the tie in with the Transfiguration in this story). Moses wore a veil to keep the fading glow under wraps. While Moses' glow faded, the light of Jesus in us is permanent. 

Join us on Sunday as we reflect on the Transfiguration from a different angle. 

>(2 Corinthians 4:6 NIV11-GK) For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God’s glory displayed in the face of Christ.
