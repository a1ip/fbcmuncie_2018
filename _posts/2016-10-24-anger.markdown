Do you struggle with a bad temper? Are there people in your life that you don't like very much? Maybe it is personal habits or characteristics that you detest. Maybe someone has hurt you and you are having a hard time letting it go. All of these descriptions have to do with anger/hatred. Proverbs has a lot to say about this topic.

We continue to explore topics in Proverbs this week. Last week, we discussed the power of our words; this week we turn to the issue of anger. While we know that righteous anger is appropriate (Jesus was angry at times), wisdom instructs us to avoid anger. Anger is a destructive emotion that affects all areas of our lives; it is impossible to compartmentalize. Join us on Sunday as we explore what wisdom says about anger.
