This week, the teenagers who served at Camp Barnabas will be presenting in both worship Services. I would encourage you to come out and hear their stories. This mission experience has had a tremendous impact on the lives of our teens. It is translated into the way they live each and every day here in Delaware County. We will gather in our usual services at 9:15 and 10:45 this week. 

Hope to see you there.
