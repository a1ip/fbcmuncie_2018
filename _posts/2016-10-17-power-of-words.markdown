The later two thirds of the book of Proverbs cover a variety of topics. I would encourage you to read through them (beginning in chapter 10). It would take considerable time to study the rest of the book verse by verse. As we look ahead to Advent, we do not have sufficient time for this task. Therefore we are going to break away from the verse by verse study. We will be looking at four topics over the next four weeks that seem primary in Proverbs. This week, we will look at the importance of our words. 

Proverbs has much to say about our words. Some scholars propose that this is the most discussed matter in the book of Proverbs with as many as 90 different mentions of the topic. We will survey the references on Sunday. For now, allow me to share one of the references with you.

>(Proverbs 18:21 NIV) The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit.

Our words have immense power; they have the power of life and death. This is a strong statement. For those who have been injured by words, we understand this description. Words can destroy, harm, injure in profound ways. At the same time, words have the power of life. A kind word can rescue from the depths of despair. Because of this, we should be careful and purposeful with the words we speak. 

I pray that God will challenge our use of words through his Word. Join us on Sunday as we consider Solomon's wisdom around our words.
