This past Sunday, we continued our study on the Ten Commandments. We covered the first few commandments. Many consider these the First Table of commandments. These commandments have to do with how we relate to God. Certainly, all of the commandments have to do with our relationship with God, but the commandments are more directly tied to our worship and allegiance to God. This week, we pick up where we left off last week. The next set of commandments are more about how we relate to one another. Let me encourage you to read this week's passage as we prepare for worship this week. See you on Sunday.

>(Exodus 20:12-16 NIV) “Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you. “You shall not murder. “You shall not commit adultery. “You shall not steal. “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
