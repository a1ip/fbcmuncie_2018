As we continue to journey through the season of Lent, we come this week to a paramount story in the life and ministry of Jesus. In John 11, we read about the resurrection of Lazarus. This is a familiar story; we have to work to hear it in fresh ways. On Sunday, we will walk through the story together. We are surprised by Jesus' apparent lack of immediacy when he hears about Lazarus' sickness. Yet we soon discover that Jesus is purposeful; he knows what he is doing. From the doubt of the disciples to the remarkable emotion of Jesus, this story is intense. Let me invite you to read John 11:1-45 as you prepare for worship on Sunday.
