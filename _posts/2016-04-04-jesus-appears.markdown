For the past few weeks (and also this coming Sunday), we will be in Luke 24. This final chapter in Luke's gospel account highlights three stories about the resurrection of Jesus. If you missed Easter or last Sunday, let me encourage you to watch or listen online. These sermons will bring up up to speed in the story. You can find the March 27 sermon [here](http://fbcmuncie.org/video/2016/03/27/he-lives/) and the April 3 sermon [here](http://fbcmuncie.org/video/2016/04/03/recognizing-jesus/). 

We come this week to the third story. With the Emmaus Road disciples freshly arrived, everyone is talking about their encounter with the resurrected Jesus. All of a sudden, Jesus appears. 

>(Luke 24:36 NIV) While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.”

We don't really know how the disciples responded to the Emmaus Road follower's story. When the women arrived from the tomb, they considered their experience _nonsense_.

>(Luke 24:11 NIV) But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.

They may have had a similar opinion. Yet on this occasion, they have little time to respond. Before they can react, Jesus shows up. On Sunday, we will explore verses 36-49 together. As the disciples encounter the risen Jesus, it takes time for reality to sink in. As you might imagine, the disciples are confused, fearful and overwhelmed by what they have experienced. But into this context, Jesus speaks. We will talk about this encounter and the implications for us today as followers of the risen Christ.
