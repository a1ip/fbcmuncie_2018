Last Sunday, we talked about Jesus' second coming. You may have expected a more *Christmas* message this time of year. However, we learned that the season of Advent is not only about Jesus' first coming; it is also about his return. As I reflect on Jesus' second coming, I realize how seldom His return is in my daily thoughts. Scripture clearly teaches that Jesus will return and calls us to keep this reality in the forefront of minds. 

In this week's passage, we will look at Paul's letter to the church at Philippi. As Paul prays for them, he is confident that God will *complete* what he starts and will carry on His work until the *day of Jesus Christ*. 

>(Philippians 1:6 NIV11-GK) he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.

Paul seems to have Jesus' return in the forefront of his mind. He is not the only one. As we survey writers in the early church, they all speak of Jesus' return. Maybe we should talk about this a bit more than we do.

Join us on Sunday as we explore Philippians 1:3-11. We will celebrate together the second Sunday in Advent as we make our way toward Christmas.
