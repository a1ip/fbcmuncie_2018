It has been a joy to journey with you through the life of Solomon. This week, we turn our attention to Reach Week. As you may remember, we spent last October and November working through the book of James. As we begin Reach Week, we will consider James' words in James 1:19-27. James challenges faith without action.

James instructs the early church,

>(James 1:22–25 NIV11-GK) Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do.

Join us on Sunday as we explore this passage. As we study together, we will find that faith without action is really no faith at all. May God challenge our inaction as He calls us to join Him on His mission in our world.
