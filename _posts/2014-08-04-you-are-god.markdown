We all have dreams and aspirations. Perhaps some hope to marry that special someone. Maybe others can envision themselves in a specific career or living in choice neighborhood. While our ambitions are varied, they keep us moving forward in life.

In 2 Samuel 7, David is thinking about all that he hopes to accomplish. He seems to be enjoying all that God has given him. He is firmly in power and the wars have ceased. As he looks around at his cedar-lined palace, he envisions building a house for God. It was common for kings to construct temples for deities. David wants to honor God in this way. He talks to his friend and prophet (Nathan) about his idea. Nathan tells him to pursue his heart's desire.

The very next day, Nathan arrives with a very different message. God spoke to him during the night; David's dream will not come to fruition in his lifetime. God reveals to Nathan that it will be David's son who will build the temple. 

David could have responded in arrogance. He could have demanded that God change his mind. He could have lamented his shattered plan and begged God to reconsider. However, David responds with humility and gratitude. 

>(2 Samuel 7:28 NIV) O Sovereign LORD, you are God! Your words are trustworthy, and you have promised these good things to your servant. 

I love that phrase. *O Sovereign LORD, you are God!* David understands that God knows best. While he envisioned being able to construct the temple, God chose to use his son (Solomon) to do this work. David is able to submit his plans to God's plans. It was not that his intentions were wrong. In fact, he will have the opportunity to lay the groundwork for the project. But God desired to use David in different ways. Certainly, God's plans for David were anything but meager. He would establish his kingdom through the coming of his Son; it would be an eternal kingdom. David's kingdom would provide everlasting salvation. 

May we learn to respond like David when God shoots down our idea. May we submit our will to God's will when his plans are different from ours. May we be able to confess that God is sovereign; He is God!
