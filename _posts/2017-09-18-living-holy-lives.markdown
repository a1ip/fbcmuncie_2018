This past Sunday, we began our 11-week study in 1 Peter. This letter is especially pertinent to our shifting culture. The church is becoming increasingly sidelined in culture. People no longer look to the church as a primary influence in society. For example, sporting events are often scheduled on Sunday morning; no thought is given to the fact that participants will not be able to attend a worship service. In addition, Christians are often regarded as weird or backward. Like Peter's first readers, Christians in 2017 must carefully consider how their lives will be lived in relationship to the world around them. 

In this week's passage (1 Peter 1:13-2:3), Peter advises his readers to *be holy*. At first glance, this seems like a lofty and impracticable reality. Yet as we delve into this passage, we will begin to understand a practical path to living out this guideline.

Join us on Sunday as we explore 1 Peter 1:13-2:3. I hope you will take few minutes to read ahead and come ready to explore this passage together.
