This coming Sunday is Pentecost Sunday; it is the birthday of the church. As we celebrate on Sunday, we will consider New Testament images of the church. There is nothing quite like the church. Yet the Bible gives us pictures/images of the church. It is not identical to the images, but they give us understanding into how the church should function.

Also, we will explore a summary statement about the church in Acts 2. As we examine what the church is doing in Acts 2, we are able to see the untainted, uncorrupted church. We will be able to assess together our functioning as a church. Luke records, in Acts 2, 

>(Acts 2:42–47 NIV) They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

Do we *really* understand the nature of the church? Are we participating in the same practices as the early church? How have misunderstandings of the church distorted our understanding of who we are? Join us on Sunday as we explore the early church on Pentecost Sunday.
