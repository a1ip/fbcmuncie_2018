We find ourselves this week in the seventh sermon in 1 Peter. We keep coming back to the dynamic of what life must have been like in the first century Roman Empire. Certainly, it was not an easy time to be a Christian. The church was suffering and trying to navigate what it meant to follow Christ in a hostile world. We come this week to a few verses that highlight the contrast of cultures. We will delve into all that the Christians were giving up as they followed Jesus. We will consider the counter-cultural shifts that many Christian faced. Peter writes,

>(1 Peter 4:3 NIV) For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to doâ€”living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry.

What did this look like? How would the first century Christians have discontinued this sort of lifestyle? How would their friends, their family respond?

>(1 Peter 4:4 NIV) They are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless, wild living, and they heap abuse on you.

Join us on Sunday as we explore the dynamics of pagan life in the first century Roman Empire. We will examine the context in which Peter is writing these words. As you prepare for worship on Sunday, let me encourage you to read 1 Peter 4:1-11.
