I came to a stop sign a few weeks ago and noticed a bumper sticker on the car in front of me. It read,

>Jesus is coming . . . Look busy!

Certainly the joke is on the Christian claim that Christ is coming again. The banter pictures everyone pretending to be active in God's work. Somehow God will presume that busyness equals faithfulness. He will look the other way and maybe we will get away with living lives for ourselves. I am doubtful that the driver of the car truly believed that Jesus is coming back. Based on the other bumper stickers, I think he was simply making fun of Christians. 

But what about Jesus' return? Much of our understanding (or perhaps misunderstanding) comes from popular books that use dramatic license to portray the second coming of Jesus. On Sunday, we will consider the words of Jesus in Mark 13. Jesus directly describes the happenings surrounding his return. 

Advent is a season of preparation. While we are getting ready for Christmas, Advent is about getting ready for God to show up. Over the next four weeks, we will follow the lectionary passages in our worship. We will consider both the first and second coming of Jesus. We are reminded of those who anticipated his first coming. As we consider the implications of God entering our world, we are aware that He will show up a second time.

I hope you will join us on Sunday as we explore Mark 13:24-37 together.
