We come this week to our last sermon in our series on the book of Proverbs. We have learned the importance of wisdom and the necessity of getting wisdom into our hearts. Certainly, we have God's Word to guide us. Yet there are times when the right path is vague. We need to discern, to listen, to allow wisdom to steer us. This week, we come to another primary issue in Proverbs. We have discussed our words, anger, money; now we come to friendship.

As with other topics in Proverbs, we do _not_ have a systematic guide to friendship. Rather we have bits of wisdom scattered throughout the book. On Sunday, we will explore these snippets together. As we prepare to engage Proverbs together, I would like to offer a few scriptures for reflection. Let me encourage you to take a few minutes to read and meditate on the following.

>(Proverbs 20:6 NIV) Many claim to have unfailing love, but a faithful person who can find?

>(Proverbs 27:17 NIV) As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.

>(Proverbs 27:6 NIV) Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses.

>(Proverbs 17:9 NIV) Whoever would foster love covers over an offense, but whoever repeats the matter separates close friends.

See you on Sunday.
