We come this week to one of the most famous stories about King Solomon. The story even made its way into prime time television in the 1990's. In the hit comedy, Seinfeld, Elaine and Kramer are having a dispute over a bicycle. Newman serves as the mediator for their dispute. He draws from the story in 1 Kings 3. He orders the bicycle cut in half to determine the true owner. 

In modern times, it is easy to understand the psychological dynamics at play. We can quickly identify the rational behind Solomon's tactic. But in Solomon's time, he did not have the vast resources we have today. Yet he had something greater. As we read last week, we know that God had granted wisdom to Solomon in extreme portions. In fact, God promised,

>(1 Kings 3:12 NIV11-GK) I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be.

This week's story reveals an example of how this works out in the real world. Join us on Sunday as we explore the story in 1 Kings 3:16-28. As we consider Solomon's wisdom, we are challenged to consider the source of our own discerning. In our day and time, we are tempted to lean into cultural understandings of business, economics, science. However, we are reminded that God given wisdom is preferred. As the story closes, we are reminded that God is the reason for Solomon's immense wisdom.

>(1 Kings 3:28 NIV11-GK) When all Israel heard the verdict the king had given, they held the king in awe, because they saw that he had wisdom from God to administer justice.

I look forward to diving deep into this story together on Sunday.
