I would like to thank Troy Hershman for preaching this past Sunday. This was his first time preaching at First Baptist. I am grateful that he took on the challenge and worked tirelessly to prepare to preach God's Word. Thank you Troy!

This coming weekend is a holiday weekend. Some of you are planning to travel and/or spend time with family. For those of us who will be gathered at First Baptist on Sunday morning, we will begin a new sermon series. This is a fairly short series, but it deals with a familiar and important story. 

The Ten Commandments have often been misunderstood. From political debates as to whether or not they belong in courtrooms to the scoffing of the commandments in popular movies, this list is fairly familiar to most people. Almost everyone could at least name a few of them. Yet the signifigance and true meaning of the Ten are often unappreciated. God offers the list to a rescued people. They are the instructions on how He wants them to live in relationship with Him and with each other. Join us on Sunday as we kick off this series.
