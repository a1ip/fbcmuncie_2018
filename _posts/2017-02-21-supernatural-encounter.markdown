As we venture through Epiphany, we come to the final Sunday of the season. On the church calendar it is called Transfiguration Sunday. As you might guess, we will be looking at this extraordinary event in Jesus' ministry. The story is recorded in three of the four gospels. It is pivot moment for Jesus and his disciples. It marks a transition from active ministry to a unflinching movement toward the cross. Luke puts it this way,

>(Luke 9:51 NIV) As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.

Luke records these words following the Transfiguration. On Sunday, we will explore the story from Matthew's account (Matthew 17:1-9). We will dip into the other gospels to fill out the account. I am sure you know the dynamics of the story. Jesus travels with his closest disciples (Peter, James and John) up a mountain. While at the summit, they encounter an unexplainable, supernatural manifestation of God's glory. They watch Jesus transfigured and joined by Moses and Elijah. The Father's voice (like the baptism) speaks affirmation and blessing on the Son. It must have been a tremendous encounter. 

Join us on Sunday as we celebrate and contemplate the Transfiguration. Let me encourage you to mediate and read Matthew 17:1-9 as you prepare for worship.
