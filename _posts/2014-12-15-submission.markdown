Sometimes life throws us curve balls. We are going about our business and suddenly everything changes. These events are sometimes welcome. Other times, they are entirely disruptive. 

There was once a teenager in ancient Palestine who was planning a wedding. Her life was on a trajectory of settling down with a local carpenter. She had no idea what was about to happen. We are given the details in Luke 1.

>(Luke 1:26–27 ESV) In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin’s name was Mary.

You have heard the story. Everyone knows what happens next. She is told that she is going to have a child. Remember, she is a virgin. She is not married and has not taken part in the act that causes pregnancy. The angel assures her that God is up to something good. He affirms God's provision and grace.

>(Luke 1:30 ESV) Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.

Mary's response is noteworthy. It gives us some indication as to why she was chosen by God for this particular task. Mary is willing to step into the unknown with God. We often forget the difficulty of this arrangement. We really don't know how Mary's parents responded. Yet trying to explain the situation to them could not have been easy. Mary's fiancée (Joseph) doesn't believe her at first. It takes an angelic visit to convince him. I am sure that she carried the stigma of an unwed mother in her home town. 

Mary's posture to this divine interruption serves as a model for us. She is willing to submit to God's direction. Join us on Sunday as we explore Luke 1:26-38. 

Reminder: We will also gather on Christmas Eve at 7 PM for a candlelight communion service. This gathering is a wonderful way to begin Christmas with your church family.
