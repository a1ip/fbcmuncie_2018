For the past few weeks, we have been talking about our mission as a church. We have discussed our _building_, our living in _community_ with one another. Last week, we centered on the word _presence_. God is present with us; as his children, we are called to practice presence as we discern God's activity in our world. 

This week, we continue to discuss God's presence as we turn our focus to children. We will be exploring two passages that give us insight into Jesus' view of children (Mark 9:33-37, 10:13-16).

Sunday is Mother's Day. Churches throughout our country will turn to the topic of motherhood. However, we will explore Jesus' teaching around children. Jesus uses children as an example of Kingdom living. 

>(Mark 9:36-37 NIV) He took a little child whom he placed among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them, “Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.”

Join us on Sunday as the children will be involved in various aspects of worship. As you prepare for worship, let me invite you to read Mark 9:33-37, 10:13-16.
