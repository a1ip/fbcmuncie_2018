I wanted to remind you all that we will be meeting in one combined service this **Sunday, April 26**. We are meeting to celebrate all that God has done through **Muncie Reach Week**. The service will include testimonies from participants in each of the seven projects along with a brief reflection on Ecclesiastes 4:9-12. All Sunday school classes will meet at 9:15 AM in the combined worship service will be at 10:45 AM.

As we consider our outreach emphasis, I would like to share a few thoughts. First of all, the participation has been commendable. Over 60 people have participated in at least one project. Secondly, all age groups have been involved in this emphasis. Many of you have been acquainted with someone from a different service through your project. Finally, the projects have covered a variety of groups and aspects of our community. From shut-ins, to developmentally disabled adults, to those living in poverty, to caring for our building, the reach of our projects have extended to many aspects of our community. 

I hope you can join us on Sunday at 10:45 AM as we celebrate **Muncie Reach Week**.
