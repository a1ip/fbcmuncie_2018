Yesterday, we kicked off our series on the book of Proverbs. I am excited to journey through this book with you. As we continue into our second week, it is important to understand the structure of Proverbs. The verses we covered last week (1:1-7) are the introduction to the book. The rest of chapters 1-9 is a series of poems about wisdom. Each poem highlights a different aspect of wisdom. This week, we come to the first poem beginning in verse 8. 

On the first reading of this week's text (Proverbs 1:8-19), it seems like a no brainer. We are warned to steer clear of gang-like influence. But when we look closer at the text, we see broader implications. We are implored to heed the instruction of our parents and to celebrate their influence as we would the victory in an athletic competition. In turn, we are advised to avoid the lures of violent and greedy companions. Their path is dangerous and ends in destruction.

>(Proverbs 1:18 NIV) These men lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush only themselves!

As we explore this text, we are keenly aware of increasing violence in our world. May we allow God's Word to speak into our world in 2016. Join us on Sunday as we delve into Proverbs 1:8-19 together.
