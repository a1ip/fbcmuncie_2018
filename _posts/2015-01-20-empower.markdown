I would like to publicly thank Doug Gregg for preaching last week. Doug led us to consider the second action word in our mission statement, *care*. This week, we move to the third word. We are going to be talking about how we *empower* one another. There are at least five ways we empower each other to live in Christ. I would like to mention these in this blog entry and give you a few scriptures to read as you prepare for Sunday.

A first way that we empower each other is by *engaging Scripture* together. God's Word has power. Read 2 Timothy 3:14-15 and 1 Peter 1:23 and 2 Timothy 3:16-17 as you prepare. A second way is by *sharing our stories* with each other. You might read 1 Peter 3:15. A third way we equip one another is by *praying* together. Take a look at Ephesians 6:18. Fourthly, we participate in *spiritual disciplines* in order to strengthen one another in our faith. You can read 1 Timothy 4:7-8. Finally, we aid each other in discovering and discerning our *spiritual gifts*. In this way we build up the body of Christ. You can read 1 Corinthians 12:12 and 1 Corinthians 12:4-5.

Join us on Sunday as we delve into the ways we empower each other to live our our faith.
