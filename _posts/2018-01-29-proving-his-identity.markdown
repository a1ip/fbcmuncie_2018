Throughout this series on the gospel of Mark, we keep coming back to Mark's main point about Jesus. In the very beginning of this gospel, Mark detailed his thesis.

>(Mark 1:1 NIV) The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God,

His entire gospel is about the *good news* of God. And this *good news* or *gospel* is about Jesus the Messiah. Each week, we discover a bit more about Jesus. And through each encounter, each healing, each conversation, Jesus is revealed once again as Messiah. 

In this week's text (Mark 4:35-6:6), we find a series of miracles and a hometown visit by Jesus. In each miracle, we witness Jesus' power over the forces of nature. From calming the stormed tossed sea to the restoration of a demon-possessed man to the healing of Jairus' daughter, Jesus reveals his capacity to handle the forces of this fallen world. At the beginning of chapter 6, Jesus makes a trip to his hometown. Sadly, their response to Jesus was one of disbelief.

>(Mark 6:3 NIV) Isn’t this the carpenter? Isn’t this Mary’s son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.

As we continue to explore Mark's gospel, I hope you will join us. As you prepare for worship on Sunday, please read Mark 4:35-6:6.
