I was talking to a friend today; he asked me a question.

>What do you think is the opposite of fear?

He works with athletes and helps them overcome the mental blocks that sometimes hold them back. I thought for a moment and responded with one word.

>Faith

If you look at *faith* from a secular perspective, it is about taking risks or stepping into the unknown. But from a spiritual perspective, *faith* is about depending on God to take care of the unknown. It is about trust; it is about counting on Him to provide what we need. Paul writes to Timothy,

>(2 Timothy 1:7 ESV) for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.

But what is the source of this power that is the opposite of fear? Faith is about placing ourselves under the rule and reign of God. It is about trusting that God will provide what we need in all circumstances. In this week's text, Paul is describing this dynamic to the church at Ephesus. He writes,

>(Ephesians 2:8–10 NIV11-GK) For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

We are acknowledging that God empowers us, equips us and has *prepared in advance* works for us. It is not about our own endeavors; we trust God through faith. This is the opposite of fear. Join us on Sunday as we study Ephesians 2:1-10 together.
