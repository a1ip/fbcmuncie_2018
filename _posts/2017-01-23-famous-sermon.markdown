As we continue through the season of Epiphany, we come to one of Jesus' more famous sermons in Matthew 5. Many call it the Sermon on the Mount. Others call it the Beatitudes which means *blessings*. No doubt this sermon is well known. John Stott says,

>The Sermon on the Mount is probably the best-known part of the teaching of Jesus, though arguably it is the least understood, and certainly it is the least obeyed.

On Sunday, we venture into Matthew 5:1-12. It is a challenging text; there is much to take in. At the same time, this passage reminds us of the mindset of Jesus and the Kingdom he came to establish. Join us on Sunday as we explore the text together.
