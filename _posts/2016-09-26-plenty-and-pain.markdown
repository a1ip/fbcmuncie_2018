This past week, we talked about trusting God. Trust is about placing our own way to the side in favor of God's way. You might recall a few key verses in the passage.

>(Proverbs 3:5-6 NIV) Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.

Trusting God is sometimes difficult. On the way out of church on Sunday, someone confessed the difficulty of trusting God when life is going well. He described the dynamic of leaning on God during strenuous life situations. However, Solomon seems to anticipate the struggle of trusting God in both the challenging and uncomplicated season of life. In Proverbs 3:9-12, Solomon address the bountiful periods of life.

>(Proverbs 3:9-10 NIV) Honor the Lord with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops; then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine.

Next, he jumps to the troublesome seasons of life. 

>(Proverbs 3:11-12 NIV) My son, do not despise the Lordâ€™s discipline, and do not resent his rebuke, because the Lord disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in.

We are once again dealing with a short text. Yet, the practical instructions offer down-to-earth application for us in 2016. Is life comfortable for you right now? If so, Solomon offers implicit ways to trust God. Do you find yourself in a taxing season of life? You may find it hard to trust God as life overwhelms you. Solomon again offers wisdom for this circumstance. Join us on Sunday as we discuss trusting in God at both extremes, in the plenty and in the pain.
