This past Sunday, we began our series on the Ten Commandments. We talked about the context in which the Commandments were given. God rescued his people from slavery and then offered them instructions on how to live. It is impossible to understand the Commandments apart from knowing the God who gave them to us. As we explore the Ten Commandments, we need to understand them as a gift from a saving/rescuing God. We ended Sunday's sermon with this quote.

"The Ten Commandments are both a gracious reminder of who we are and an abrasive prod to be who we ought to be." Hauerwas and Willimon

This week, we will look at what some scholars call the First Table. Depending on which list you use (we will talk more about this on Sunday), we will be discussing the first three or four commandments. We will be talking about:

1. You shall have no other gods before me.
2. You shall not make for yourself an idol ... You shall not bow down to them or worship them.
3. You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God.
4. Remember the Sabbath day, and keep it holy ... You shall not do any work -- you, your son or your daughter, your male and female slave, your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns.

All of these commandments have to do with our how we relate to God. I am looking forward to discussing them more with you on Sunday. See you then.
