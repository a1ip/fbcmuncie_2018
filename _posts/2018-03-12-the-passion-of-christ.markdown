This past Sunday, we explored what scholars call the Olivet Discourse in Mark 13. If you missed the sermon, you can catch up by [watching online](http://fbcmuncie.org/video/2018/03/11/getting-ready) or [subscribing to the podcast](http://fbcmuncie.org/podcast/). This text serves as a bridge between the ministry of Jesus and the Passion story or narrative. This Sunday, we begin the story of Jesus' betrayal and arrest. On Palm Sunday (March 25), we will talk about the crucifixion of Jesus. As you can see, we are making our way toward Easter. 

We will be covering a large portion of the story this week (Mark 14:1-15:15). Let me encourage you to read ahead as you prepare for worship on Sunday.
