In the introduction of Sunday's sermon, I will share the story of Veggie Tales being sold to NBC in 2006. You can [read more about it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeggieTales#NBC_controversy) if you like. The short of it is that NBC found references to God's love offensive and removed them from the show (along with Bob and Larry). It is hard to imagine a kid's TV show talking about God as disrespectful. The reality is that the Bible contains far more unpleasant language. In fact, the entirety of God's salvation plan does not make sense to most. Paul understood the dynamic; he writes to the church at Corinth,

>(1 Corinthians 1:18 NIV11-GK) For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing

If you step back from the story and really think about it, you can understand what Paul is saying. Crucifixion is a grotesque and cruel form of execution. Yet, we display crosses in our worship space. How does this make sense?

In 1 Corinthians 1:18-31, Paul describes God's message as offensive to the surrounding culture. At the same time, God's plan of salvation is incredible news to those who "get it".

>(1 Corinthians 1:18 NIV11-GK) but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.

Join us on Sunday as we explore this dynamic. As some you know, we did not observe the Lord's Supper due to the snow storm last Sunday. This week's text will be a powerful precursor to the Table as we gather on Sunday. Hope you see you there.
