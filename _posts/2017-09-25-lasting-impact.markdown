This series in 1 Peter has been a rich and applicable study. We have found Peter's words to the first century church particularly pertinent in 2017. This week, we come to another valuable text. As we study 1 Peter 2:4-10, we will find Peter's use of familiar images especially helpful as we consider our role in God's kingdom.

Peter describes early Christians (and us) as *living stones*. Stones are an exceptionally strong building material. They seem to outlast all other elements of a building. As we were traveling in Europe this summer, the stones from ancient structures were visible reminders of once grand edifices. What a great image for God's people.

This Sunday, we will consider our lives as *living stones*. We will talk about the lasting impact of kingdom-oriented lives. May we consider how God will use us to build a spiritual building in the places where He has placed us.

>(1 Peter 2:5 NIV) you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
