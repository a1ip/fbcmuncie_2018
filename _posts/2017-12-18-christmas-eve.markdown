Christmas is only a week away. Throughout the Advent season, we have anticipated Christmas. But more than that, we have anticipated the coming of Jesus. This week, we move to the New Testament as we explore Luke's account of the first Christmas. We focus, this week, primarily on Mary's response to God's plan for her. She was called to exhibit extreme faith, dependence on God. I would encourage you to read Luke 1:26-38 as you prepare for morning worship.

Don't forget, we will gather in a combined service at 10:45 AM this week. 

Christmas Eve at 7 PM, we will gather for our traditional candlelight, communion service. For our family, this is a special way to begin Christmas. I hope you will plan on joining us. The passage for this service will be Isaiah 9:2-7. 

See you on Sunday.
