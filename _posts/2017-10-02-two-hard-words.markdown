For the past several weeks, we have been discussing the dynamics of our changing culture. Our world is not as different from the first century as it was 50-100 years ago. I am referring to the way in which Christians are in the minority and the church no longer holds a place of prominence in our society. As we consider Peter's words to the church scattered throughout the Roman Empire, we can find relevance to our culture in 2017. This week, we will consider Peter's advice to Christians living in this context.

Peter highlights two words that are hard to digest in American culture. The first word is _abstain_. We prefer the word _indulge_; we like to live it up. Yet Peter knows that Christians will need to forgo *sinful desires* if they are going to properly reflect God in their world. The second word is no easier; Peter instructs us to _submit_. Again we prefer to _dominate_ or exert _power_. Yet Peter directs us to submit in the posture of Jesus.

Join us on Sunday as we explore 1 Peter 2:11-25 together.
