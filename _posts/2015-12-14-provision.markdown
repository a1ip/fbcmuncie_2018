As we come to the final Sunday in Advent, we will shift our study a bit closer to the Christmas story. We will consider Mary's response to God's provision in her life. 

In this week's text, we find Mary surprised by the angel's message. Perhaps confused and searching for answers, she travels to the home of her relative, Elizabeth. The journey would have been 80-100 miles; it would have taken her 3-4 days. As Mary traveled, she must have been nervous. How many times do you think Mary rehearsed her conversation with Elizabeth? Would her relative think she is crazy? It all seemed beyond belief. 

But when Mary arrives at Elizabeth's home, she is surprised. God had taken care of the situation. Elizabeth and her husband Zechariah had a supernatural encounter prior to Mary's arrival. Mary did not have to explain. She did not have to make her case to Elizabeth. Luke describes their greeting,

>(Luke 1:41 NIV11-GK) When Elizabeth heard Maryâ€™s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.

The Holy Spirit steps in and shines the light of truth onto a complex situation. When Mary experiences God's provision, she is overwhelmed and praises God. Join us on Sunday as we explore this passage together. As we come to this final Sunday before Christmas, we will study Luke 1:39-55 together.
