Last week, we considered what some call *The Beatitudes* or _blessings_ found in Matthew 5. Jesus redefines what it means to be blessed. While the first century culture (as well as our culture) associates blessing with power, prestige, financial resources and the such, Jesus turns the tables and speaks of the poor in spirit, the meek, the persecuted as blessed. This week, we continue in Matthew 5. We pick up in verse 13,

>(Matthew 5:13 NIV) “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.

This is a striking description for Jesus' disciples. Jesus anticipates the inhabitants of His kingdom as making tremendous impact in their world. He continues,

>(Matthew 5:14 NIV) “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.

They are salt; they are light. Like a hilltop village, they are in view of everyone. Not only does Jesus want his hearers to understand this, but he challenges them to be intentional in this manner.

>(Matthew 5:16 NIV) In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.

Salt and light are powerful descriptors. What does it mean that Jesus would use these words to describe us? How might we think of our presence in this world as we understand this text? Join us on Sunday as we explore Matthew 5:13-16 together.
