Just a quick reminder that we will be gathering in one combined service this Sunday (October 29) at **10:45 AM**. All Sunday school classes will meet during the early hour at 9:15 AM. 

This week will also be week in which Legacy Campaign cards will be accepted during the worship service. Toward the end of the service, we will have a time of prayer. During this time, everyone will be invited (in shifts) to come and offer prayers for our building. We want to express our gratitude for God's provision as well as pray for future ways in which the building will serve as a blessing to our community. Baskets will be placed toward the front of the church; you will have an opportunity to drop your cards in the baskets as you come forward. If you do not bring a card, you will still be invited to pray.

Finally, I want to mention our text for this Sunday. This passage has puzzled theologians and scholars throughout history. I will not say much in this blog post, but want to encourage you to read it before coming to worship. The passage is 1 Peter 3:18-22. I will include it below in two different versions.

>(1 Peter 3:18-22 NIV) For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit. After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits— to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at God’s right hand—with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.

>(1 Peter 3:18-22 ESV) For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.

Finally, we celebrate with Emma and Grace Wright as they will be baptized on Sunday. See you then.
