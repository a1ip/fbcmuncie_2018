As we continue our sermon series over the life of the 12 disciples, we begin our second group of 4 this week. The top four, if you will, are Peter, James, John and Andrew. These sets of brothers are the most well-known disciples and appear to be the closest to Jesus. In every list of disciples, Philip is the 5th disciple; perhaps he was the lead disciple in this second group. 

We find Philip early on in Jesus' ministry. In fact, Jesus finds him in the wilderness (along with Andrew and John). Philip was searching for God's movement along with the other fishermen (John 1:43-46). However, the bible's descriptions of Philip portray him as a by-the-book kind of guy; he seems to lack the ability to envision the impossible. He questions Jesus at the feeding of the 5K and the Last Supper. When a group of Greek seekers petition Philip to see Jesus, Philip does not know what to do. He turns them over to Andrew who in turn brings them to Jesus. 

As we consider Philip on Sunday, we are challenged to trust Jesus. Like Philip, we all have the tendency limit the movement of God to what we know. May we learn to expand our horizons and discern God's movement among us. May we open our hearts and minds to the unimaginable, trusting that God can do whatever he wants.

>(Matthew 19:26 NIV) Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
