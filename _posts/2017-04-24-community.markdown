For several months now, we have been planning the upcoming summer. I have been working through the ideas and facets of our new mission emphasis *Building. Community. Presence*. It is nice to finally work out these ideas on Sunday morning. This past Sunday, we discussed the first of three words, *Building*. We talked about this word as a noun and a verb. If you were not able to attend on Sunday, I would encourage to listen online by [subscribing to the podcast](http://fbcmuncie.org/podcast) or [watching the video](http://fbcmuncie.org/video/2017/04/23/building). 

This week, we come to the second word, *Community*. Like *Building*, *Community* is a loaded word. It is a very common expression in today's culture; you hear it all over the place. However, overuse of a concept often dilutes its meaning. *Community* has do with holding something in common with others. It sometimes refers to the commonality of a geographic location. Other times it refers to shared beliefs or ideas. It is about joining together in relationship with others.

On Sunday, we will explore God's understanding of community. This is a deep and complex issue beginning with God himself and extending to building relationships with those around us. I hope you will join us on Sunday as we talk about our calling at First Baptist to live in community with others.
