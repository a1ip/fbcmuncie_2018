We come, this week, to a passage in 1 Peter that might seem disconnected from the other texts. Peter seems to shift gears addressing husbands and wives. Some might think that these words have little to do with their situation. Yet as we connect his words to the rest of the letter, we find a common theme and words of pertinence for all.

Peter is addressing particular dynamics of first century households. Women in this day and time were dominated by men. Men often controlled their wives, treating them like property. While these dynamics seem primitive to our modern world, Peter's instructions do apply to us in 2017. Let me invite you to read 1 Peter 3:1-7 as you prepare to attend worship on Sunday.
