This past Sunday was a wonderful day. It is always a highlight of the year to see everyone gathered to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus. With out of town guests, college students home with family and even a newborn at church for the first time, our coming together for worship was a delight.

You might be surprised to know that Easter did not end at midnight on Sunday evening. In fact, the season of Easter lasts all the way until Pentecost Sunday (May 20th this year). During the season of Easter, we will be considering the various post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. This week, we pick up in John 20:19-31 with Jesus' appearance to his disciples.

All the disciples are huddled together in fear (except for Thomas). Jesus appears and has a conversation with them. When Thomas returns, he refuses to believe that Jesus came to them. He claims he will need to touch Jesus' hands and inspect his side if he is going to believe. A week later, Jesus appears again. This time Thomas is present. Join us on Sunday as we talk about Thomas and his tendency to doubt.

As you prepare for worship, let me invite you to read John 20:19-31. See you on Sunday.
