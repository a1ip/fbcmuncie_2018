In our text this week, we have a very familiar passage of Scripture. Perhaps you are familiar with it.

>(Proverbs 3:5-6 NIV) Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.

No doubt this is a powerful text. Maybe it is popular because it speaks directly to the subject of trusting God. Trust is not an easy function. It involves a loss of control as well as a dependence on someone or something outside of our supervision. It involves a letting go and releasing. This passage reminds us that God is worthy of our trust. If we can somehow give our lives (all of our ways) over to God's jurisdiction, we will find *straight paths*. And straight paths are better than crooked paths. They are less complicated and easier to navigate.

Join us on Sunday as we explore Proverbs 3:1-8. We will place verses 5-6 in the context of the rest of the chapter, really the rest of Proverbs. We will find that trusting God involves a remembering of his commands and a shunning of evil. It also involves an appropriate view of our way of doing things in contrast to allowing God to be in control. It should be a fun and applicable study. Hope to see you there.
