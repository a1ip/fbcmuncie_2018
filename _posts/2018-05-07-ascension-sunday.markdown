We are quickly making our way through the 50 days of Easter. This Sunday, we come to Ascension Sunday. We have been discussing the difficult nature of Jesus' departure. His disciples have enjoyed personal time with him and it is coming to an end. We will be studying Acts 1:1-11 this week. I would encourage you to read ahead as you prepare for worship.

This coming Sunday is also Mother's Day and Effie Massoth's dedication. It will be a wonderful time to celebrate the gift of motherhood and honor women in our church on this special day.

See you on Sunday.
