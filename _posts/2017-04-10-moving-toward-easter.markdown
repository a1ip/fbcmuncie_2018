This is perhaps the most significant week on the church calendar. As we move toward Sunday, we reflect on what this week must have been like for Jesus. We consider his last meal with his disciples on Thursday evening. We ponder the intensity of his crucifixion on Friday. We contemplate the disappointment of the disciples on Saturday as they allowed the events of the previous day to sink in.

But on Sunday, the sadness and despondency of Jesus' death was made right. Join us on Sunday as we celebrate the Risen Christ at 9:15 AM and 10:45 AM in our regularly scheduled services. We will also gather on Friday (noon) at First Baptist along with other churches for a special Good Friday service. I hope you will read Matthew 28:1-10 as you prepare for worship. See you on Friday and/or Sunday.
