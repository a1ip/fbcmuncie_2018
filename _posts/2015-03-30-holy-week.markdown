The world turns its attention this week to the story that we celebrate all year long. It is Holy Week. On Friday, we will gather as a community at Union Missionary Baptist Church to celebrate the crucifixion of Jesus. That doesn't sound quite right, does it? Celebrating a crucifixion? Yet we have experienced the tremendous power of Jesus' death on the Cross. We are bold in calling this day *Good Friday*. The community-wide service begins at noon.

On Sunday, we will gather in two gatherings (9:15 and 10:45 AM) to celebrate the Risen Christ. We will explore Matthew's recording of the women at the tomb (Matthew 28:1-10). There will be a light brunch available between services (10:15-10:45 AM). I hope that you will plan on joining us for this special day. Let me encourage you to invite someone to join you.

See you on Sunday!
