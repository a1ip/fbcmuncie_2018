We come this week to John 3:1-17. I love this story. We find Jesus in conversation with a religious leader named Nicodemus. This man is an authentic seeker. He wants to know more about Jesus, yet he knows that his reputation may be at stake. Therefore, he approaches Jesus at night.

The conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus is fascinating. Jesus tells him,

>(John 3:3 NIV) Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.”
 
Nicodemus' response is practical. He doesn't understand how this works out.

>(John 3:4 NIV) “How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!”

Jesus unpacks a spiritual mystery in the next few verses. We learn much from his words.

>(John 3:5-8 NIV) Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You must be born again.’ The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”

Jesus challenges Nicodemus' belief and criticizes the *lack of understanding* of the religious leaders. How can we understand Jesus' words to Nicodemus? What does it mean to be born again in this way. Join us on Sunday as we explore this passage together: John 3:1-17.
