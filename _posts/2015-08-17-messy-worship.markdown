Preaching on the descriptions of the palace and temple have been somewhat challenging. There is not always immediate application for our lives today in such ancient architectural details. However, as we come this week to the furniture of the temple, we are able to connect with the author of Hebrews. Through the lens of the temple, we better understand the work of Jesus on the Cross. 

The temple was made for worship. And worship in ancient Israel involved animal sacrifice. The temple furniture reminds us of this messy work. Lots of water and bowls were needed to clean up blood. As we consider the implications of the temple tools, we realize that forgiveness of sins comes at a price. 

Join us on Sunday as we continue to study Solomon's temple in 1 Kings 7:13-51. 

>(Hebrews 10:10 NIV11-GK) we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
