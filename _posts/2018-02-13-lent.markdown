This coming Sunday is the first Sunday in the season of Lent. We are reminded that Easter is coming quickly. Yet in this season of Lent, we walk with Jesus toward the Cross. As Jesus makes his way to Jerusalem, he continues to explain the coming events to the disciples. They don't seem to understand why he has to suffer, to die. In this week's text, Mark walks us through the events of the Transfiguration and Jesus' conversations with his disciples about what it means to enter the Kingdom of God. 

As we prepare for worship this week, let me encourage you to read Mark 8:27-9:50. I hope to see you in worship on Sunday as we explore this text together.
