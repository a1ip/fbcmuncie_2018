We have been talking a lot about wisdom over the last few weeks. This Sunday, we will continue to explore the value of wisdom. We might ask the question, *Is wisdom really that important?* In this week's text, Solomon highlights the significance of living a life of wisdom. Our passage is Proverbs 3:13-35. I will highlight just a few facets in this entry; we will dig deeper on Sunday in worship. 

Wisdom is more beneficial than anything else that our hearts may desire.

>(Proverbs 3:13-15 NIV) Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding, for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold. She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her.

*Nothing* is a strong word. It literally means *no thing*. For Solomon to consider *no desired thing* higher than wisdom is a profound statement. We live in a marketing culture that makes walloping assertions about products and services. We have learned to take such pronouncements lightly. But Solomon is not trying to *sell* us on this idea of wisdom. He has found the usefulness of wisdom in his life; he wants us to experience the same. He knows that our lives will be exceedingly better if we have wisdom.

In this week's passage, Solomon describes what a wisdom-filled life looks like. He concludes this section by laying out the result of wisdom.

>(Proverbs 3:35 NIV) The wise inherit honor, but fools get only shame.

Is wisdom worth it? Certainly. Join us on Sunday as we allow God's Word to do its work in us. Let me invite you to read ahead and come prepared to encounter Proverbs 3:13-35 together.
