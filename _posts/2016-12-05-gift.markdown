The season of Advent is a season of anticipation. As we continue to journey together toward Christmas, we consider the remarkable gift we have been given in Jesus. This coming Sunday, we will explore the first few verses of Paul's letter to the Romans. In these verses, Paul highlights the extraordinary way in which we have been included in God's story. Paul highlights the fact that God has been at work in the world for a long time.

>(Romans 1:2 NIV) the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures

The gospel or *good news* was promised long ago. Too often we forget God's story began long before that special night in Bethlehem. The Old Testament (the *Holy Scriptures*) highlights God's promise of salvation. But it doesn't stop there. The cool part is that we are included. Paul puts it this way.

>(Romans 1:5 NIV) Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith for his nameâ€™s sake.

The grace (unmerited gift) that he received and apostleship (God given authority) to call us (the Gentiles) to faith is an amazing gift. Join us on Sunday as we consider how this works out.
