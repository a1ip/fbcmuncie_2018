It is easy to be overwhelmed by the stress of life. Busy schedules, terrorist attacks, disease, deadlines all bring anxiety. This week's text is one of my favorite passages of Scripture. Paul is writing to the church at Philippi from jail. His life circumstances are anything but calm. Yet he challenges them to look beyond their circumstances to greater realities of God's provision. 

The passage is fairly brief.

>(Philippians 4:4â€“7 NIV11-GK) Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

As we prepare for worship on Sunday, allow me to prompt you to mediate on this passage throughout the week. As the stress of life builds, God's Word has the power to re-focus our lives toward God's vantage point. The children will be singing in both services. We will also study Philippians 4:4-7 as we gather on Sunday. I hope to see you there on this third Sunday in Advent.
