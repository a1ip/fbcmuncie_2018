Our journey through Proverbs has been a little slow. We are just now moving into chapter 2 this week. I have enjoyed the first chapter and have found it to be incredibly applicable to our lives in 2016. The second chapter has similar language and a complementary message to what we have been talking about so far. Solomon charges us to take hold of wisdom and keep it close.

>(Proverbs 2:1-5 NIV) My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you, turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understandingâ€” indeed, if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding, and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure, then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God.

Wisdom does not automatically make it way into our hearts. We must accept it, store it up, turn our ear and apply it to our lives. The rest of the chapter explains the benefits of taking such action. Growing in wisdom, growing in God takes effort. Yet if we pursue wisdom, the benefits will far outweigh the toil.

Join us on Sunday as we explore Proverbs 2. I would encourage you to read it ahead of time and come prepared to engage it together.
