I have enjoyed working through this series on the post-resurrection appearances. Jesus could have risen from the dead and ascended just a few days later. But this is not what he did. He continued to form and work in the lives of his followers for 50 days. He clarified who he was and what he had come to do. His appearances also serve to restore the failures of his disciples. 

In this week's text, John 21, Jesus shares a meal with his closest companions on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. This fish breakfast serves to encourage a group of men who had utterly failed. 

Join us on Sunday as we explore this facinating story. I hope you will take a few minutes to read John 21 as you prepare for worship. See you on Sunday.
