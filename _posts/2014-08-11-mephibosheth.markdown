Sunday's worship will feature testimonies by our teenagers who served at Camp Barnabas this summer. At the same time, we will continue the story of David's life. The connection is uncanny. In this week's text, we come upon the story of Mephibosheth. Are you familiar with this layer of the story?

David is settled in as king. As we talked about last week, David had subdued his enemies. We read toward the end of chapter 8,

>(2 Samuel 8:15 NIV) David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all his people.

As we flip over to chapter 9, David asks a question.

>(2 Samuel 9:1 NIV) David asked, “Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan’s sake?” 

It was common for kings to diligently seek out and kill any remaining relatives of the previous king. This would secure his kingdom. But David is not inquiring of relatives so that he can kill them. He wants to show kindness to them. He calls in a servant of Saul's household; he figures he will know. There just so happens to be a son of Jonathan still living. Look at how he is described.

>(2 Samuel 9:3 NIV) he is crippled in both feet

You have to wonder if Saul's servant fears the worst; maybe David will kill him. If David knows his condition, perhaps he will spare his life. David calls for this son of Jonathan, Mephibosheth. The story unfolds with David unleashing extravagant grace on Mephibosheth. He gives him servants, land and makes sure that he is dining at the king's table each night. 

David understands grace; he has been given much. The appropriate response for David is to extend this grace to others. This picture of a crippled man dining at the king's table reveals David's heart. As we serve others, our hearts become more like God's heart. Join us on Sunday as we reflect on the story of Mephibosheth and hear the stories of our teens as they spent a week serving.
