I conducted a funeral on Monday for a man I have never met. I sat down with his family on Sunday afternoon to discuss his life and what they would like shared at his funeral. One of the characteristics about this man was the fact that he had a good mind. He actually has two patents in his name. He developed several systems that proved to be a significant cost savings for his company. We might say that he was smart. But would we use the word wise to describe this man? Maybe he was also a wise man. I do not know since I never met him. Yet having the brain power to invent is not the same thing as having wisdom.

This week, we begin our sermon series in the book of Proverbs. We are going to be talking a lot about wisdom over the next months. Wisdom involves knowledge, but it is more than intelligence. Wisdom includes experience but it is deeper than familiarity with a particular topic. In Proverbs, we learn that wisdom begins with fearing God. Solomon writes,

>(Proverbs 1:7 NIV) The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.

There are many sides and angles in describing wisdom. We will talk about how we get wisdom and how we keep wisdom front and center in our lives. Join us on Sunday as we open our series in the book of Proverbs. We will be looking together at Proverbs 1:1-7. Hope to see you there.
