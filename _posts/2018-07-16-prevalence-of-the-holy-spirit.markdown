We begin a new sermon series on Sunday. I have been excited about this series for a number of weeks. As I have prepared each week, my excitement has only grown. As many of you know, I usually work anywhere from 4-6 weeks out on my sermons. I have been living with these ideas for quite a while. I can't wait to share them with you on Sunday.

In this opening sermon, we will be talking about the prevalence of the Holy Spirit though the entire bible. We often think of the Holy Spirit as primarily active in the book of Acts and the Epistles. Yet, as we will talk about this week, the Holy Spirit is central in all of Scripture. We find Jesus empowered by the Spirit in all that he does through his life and ministry. We find the Spirit moving and working before Jesus shows up. He is all over the place.

We will be looking at a variety of passages on Sunday. I hope you plan to attend worship this week ready to engage God's Word together around the topic of the Holy Spirit.
