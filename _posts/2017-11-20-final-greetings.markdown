We come this week to our final study in Peter's first epistle. This has been an enlightening study for me. If you have been involved in this series, you know that we have considered our changing culture. We have discussed how we are moving toward a world that resembles the first century Roman Empire in terms of Christianity's place in society. Most of us realize that church is no longer at the center of culture. So what does this mean for us? How might we need to adjust how we function in this new world?

In the last few verses of this letter (1 Peter 5:12-14), we will survey Peter's sending remarks. This is a short passage; yet a few key words in this passage inform how we should function as a congregation.

I hope you will take a few minutes to read this succinct passage as you prepare for worship on Sunday.

>(1 Peter 5:12-14 NIV) With the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it. She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark. Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
