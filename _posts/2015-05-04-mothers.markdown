This coming Sunday is Mother's Day. Don't forget about your mom or even those in your life who have mothered you. On Sunday, we will recognize our mothers in worship, but the sermon will not be about Mother's Day. We will continue our study in 1 John.

This week, we come to chapter 5. While the text will not center on mothers, it will address the dynamic of children of God. Have you ever wondered if you were in the family? Have you ever questioned what it means to be a child of God. John's words are instructive; he gets right to the point.

>(1 John 5:1â€“2 NIV11-GK) Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well. This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands.

On Sunday, we will unpack this text. We will explore the dynamic of living as a child of God. We will find that it is not a burdensome task. At the same time, living as a part of God's family requires accountability. It is not a hard and fast list of dos and don'ts. Yet obedience is certainly a part of the mix. Join us on Sunday as we explore what it means to live as a child of God.
