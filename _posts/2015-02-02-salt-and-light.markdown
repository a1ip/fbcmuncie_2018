We come this week to the final sermon in our mission series. We have been working through our mission statement over the past four weeks. 

>We are a Spirit-led people gathered to care for and empower each other by stewarding God's resources to impact our community for Christ  

This week, we will talk about the way we *impact* those around us for Christ. God's story has always included a reaching out to those who are not a part of God's people. In the Old Testament, we find God commanding his people to *proclaim his name to the nations*. 

>(1 Chronicles 16:8 NIV11-GK) Give praise to the LORD, proclaim his name; make known among the nations what he has done.

In the psalms, God's people are admonished to let others know of God's rule and reign. 

>(Psalms 9:11 NIV11-GK) Sing the praises of the LORD, enthroned in Zion; proclaim among the nations what he has done.

Throughout the prophets, God's identity is announced to other nations. God is deeply concerned that we reflect him to those we encounter each and every day.

Jesus used two images when teaching about this dynamic. He described his followers as *salt* and *light*. On Sunday, we will explore Matthew 5:13-16. Join us as we consider our impact on the community around us.
