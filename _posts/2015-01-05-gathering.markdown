Over the next several weeks, we will be exploring our mission statement at First Baptist Muncie. Newer members may find the statement unfamiliar. Certainly, it is printed in the bulletin each week. Yet we have not explored the statement in worship for nearly three years. It is time to revisit our mission together.

Our mission statement is fairly simple. It reads,

>We are a Spirit-led people gathered to care for and empower each other by stewarding God's resources to impact our community for Christ.

The five words (gather, care, empower, steward and impact) mirror our church polity. We have coordinators for each of these areas. We will explain this further as we discuss each area. We will spend five weeks in this series (one for each word). 

This week, we will be talking about what it means to gather. In a world of social media, we engage in numerous interactions each day. But there is something about physically gathering that is different. Why should we take the time to crawl out of bed and drive down to the church each week? Why should we carve out time in our busy schedules to spend time together in small groups (life groups or Sunday school classes)? Is is really that important that we serve together in mission projects? 

Join us on Sunday as we explore the purpose of our gathering. We will find that our coming together models the work of God through Jesus Christ. We will find that our assembling is crucial to who we are as the people of First Baptist Church Muncie. 

If you have been at First Baptist for less than three years, I hope you will make a special effort to engage in each of these studies. My hope is that this series will renew our purpose as a congregation as we are faithful to God's leading in all we do.

>(Hebrews 10:24–25 NIV) And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
