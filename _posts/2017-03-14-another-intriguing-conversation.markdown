It is fun to read about Jesus' conversations with those who are trying to figure Him out. Last week, we talked about Nicodemus. This religious leader was wanting to know more about Jesus' identity. In turn, Jesus explains the larger picture of God's Kingdom and invites Nicodemus to be a part of it. 

This week, we come to another encounter. Jesus engages a Samaritan women at a well outside of a village. While the disciples are on an errand, Jesus strikes up a conversation. We will talk more on Sunday about the perceived inappropriateness of this exchange. Yet Jesus crosses gender, social, cultural and religious boundaries to confer with this nameless woman. 

The conversation is intriguing and reveals Jesus' mission to seek and save those who are lost (Luke 19:10). Join us on Sunday as we explore John 4:5-42.
