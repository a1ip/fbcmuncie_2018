It was wonderful to join the Revolution in worship on Sunday. In yesterday's late service, we experienced a full building and ten baptisms. The energy in the room was tremendous. We will look forward to doing this again in the future. This week, we shift gears a bit and turn back to the lectionary for our weekly text. You might be surprised to find us in Revelation this week. 
 
Throughout the Easter season, we have been walking through post-resurrection encounters (Luke 24). Jesus appears on multiple occasions to his disciples. Each time, he teaches them the entire story of God. He goes back to the very beginning and explains how the Messiah fulfills all that God has been doing. This week, we shift to the end of the story. Jesus, this time, reveals to John how the story is going to unfold. 

We have not spent a lot of time as a congregation in the book of Revelation. Some find it difficult to understand and arduous to navigate. However, the plot line is thrilling. We will venture into Revelation 21:1-6 together on Sunday. I hope you will take a few minutes to read the passage before attending worship. 

>(Revelation 21:1-6 NIV) Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,” for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.” He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.
