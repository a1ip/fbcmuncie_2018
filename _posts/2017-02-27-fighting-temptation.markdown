This Sunday marks the first Sunday in the season of Lent. Levi (my 12 year old son) informed me on Sunday that he is planning on participating in Lent this year. He told me that he had carefully chosen to give up chores :)

On a serious note, Lent is the season of walking with Jesus toward the cross. We consider the struggle and intensity of suffering he experienced as he lived among us. This week, we will engage the fourth chapter of Matthew. In the first eleven verses of this chapter, we witness Jesus' encounter with the devil.

>(Matthew 4:1 NIV) Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.

Jesus has been fasting for 40 days. On the one hand, he is physically pushed to the limits of the human body. At the same time, he has the spiritual force of having fasted for a prolonged period of time. In verse 3, the _devil_ is called the _tempter_.

>(Matthew 4:3 NIV) The tempter came to him ...

On Sunday, we will explore all three temptations recorded in this chapter. We will find support for our temptations in these verses. Perhaps God will reveal sources of strength for us today as we battle the evil one. Join us on Sunday as we begin this important season on the church calendar.
