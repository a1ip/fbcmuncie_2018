This week, we gather for our annual Harvest Sunday. It is a special combined service (10:45 AM); this year we have several special guests. The Taylor University Gospel Choir will be sharing in music and missionaries from the Philippines (Dan and Brittany Barr) will be relating their story. We will also be talking about gratitude and reflecting on Psalm 107:1-3, 17-22 together. Following the service, we will assemble for a shared meal.

As we celebrate Thanksgiving, we consider the dynamics of gratitude. To be thankful requires a recognition that we have been given. When we say *thank you*, we are acknowledging a benefit. We have received or acquired; our response is one of gratefulness. Psalm 107 aids our expression of gratitude to God. The psalm begins,

>(Psalm 107:1 NIV) Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.

The psalmist names all of the ways that God has poured out His blessings. He then repeats a phrase over and over. It is found in verses 8, 15, 21 and 31.

>Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men, 

We are encouraged to *give thanks to the LORD*. Why? Because of *his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men*. If we took the time on Sunday to allow people to share the ways that God has blessed them, we would hear deed after deed. Surely, God has given us much and continues to do so day after day. Our response should be one of gratitude. 

We will also explore a story from Luke 17 on Sunday. Jesus heals 10 lepers and only one returns to offer thanks. I hope you can join us on Sunday as we gather. It is a great way to begin your Thanksgiving celebration.
