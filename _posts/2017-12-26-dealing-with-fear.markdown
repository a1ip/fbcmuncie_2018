As we come to this last week of 2017, we consider the year behind us. Many news agencies, podcasts and even TV shows will highlight 2017. We will see *best of* episodes or even predictions about the coming year. On Sunday morning, we will consider a topic that has dominated 2017; we will be talking about fear. 

In some ways, our world seems more unstable than ever. Increasing violence and cultural shifts make us feel as though the ground beneath us is crumbling. As a society, we seem to be on pins and needles. The bible has much to say about fear and anxiety. We will spend our last Sunday of 2017 (in one combined service at 10:45 AM) discussing God's take on fear. I hope to see you on Sunday.
