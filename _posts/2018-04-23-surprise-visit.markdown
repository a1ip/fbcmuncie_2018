For the last several weeks, we have been talking about the post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. This week's story may be one that you did not consider. It is much later. In fact, this appearance happens after Jesus' ascension. 

In Acts 9, we find the conversion of Saul. If you remember the story, Saul is ravishing the Christian community. He is even traveling to other cites to capture and arrest followers of Jesus. As he makes his way toward Damascus, Jesus appears to him. This is a dramatic and life-altering visit for Saul.

Join us on Sunday as we explore this story together. I would encourage you to read ahead in Acts 9:1-31, 1 Corinthians 15:3-9.
