Being a parent is a tough job. As kids grow older, you have to give them more freedom and responsibility. At the same time, they desperately need guidance along the way. As we consider David's parenting, we know that did not deserve the "World's Best Dad" mug. In more than one place, we are told that he was an absentee father with spoiled kids. 

However, as we come to 1 Kings 2, we find David uncharacteristically involved in the life of his son, Solomon. He is nearing death and knows that his time is short. He offers advice to the new king. David masterfully instructs his son. He gives clear advice while allowing Solomon the freedom to implement his instructions. 

David's advice is helpful as we consider the most important facets of life. He gently guides his son,

>(1 Kings 2:2–4 NIV11-GK) I am about to go the way of all the earth,” he said. “So be strong, act like a man, and observe what the LORD your God requires: Walk in obedience to him, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and regulations, as written in the Law of Moses. Do this so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go.

Join us on Sunday as we explore David's directions to Solomon.
