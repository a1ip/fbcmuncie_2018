As we make our way toward Easter, we have been walking with Jesus through various aspects of His ministry. This week, we journey to His final week. In Matthew 27:11-54, we are able to traverse the distinct stages of Jesus' arrest, trial and death. 

Holy Week is the designation for the time between Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday. For many, this is a special time of reflection on Jesus' suffering. Many will gather on Thursday evening (Maundy Thursday) in services around the world to consider Jesus' last hours with his disciples before His death. Others will gather on Friday (Good Friday) to contemplate the crucifixion of Jesus. Note: A Community-wide Good Friday service will be held at First Baptist at noon on Friday, April 14. Exploring Matthew 27:11-54 together is an appropriate way to begin Holy Week.

I hope you will take time this week to read Matthew 27:11-54 as you prepare for worship on Sunday.
