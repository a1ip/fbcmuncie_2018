This week's text is difficult to preach (1 Kings 6). The scripture outlines the building specs for the temple. It is not easy to find application for our lives today in such a description. However, the New Testament speaks much about the temple. It is important for us to fully understand the 1 Kings 6 if we are going to adequately interpret the New Testament's passages about the temple. So here is the plan for Sunday.

We will take a reading tour of the temple from 1 Kings 6. Hopefully, by the time we are done, everyone will have a good idea of what the temple looked like (inside and out). We will then explore Paul's description of the temple in the New Testament. You may not be surprised to find that God's temple is now *in* us.

>(1 Corinthians 3:16–17 NIV11-GK) Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst? If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person; for God’s temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.

A few chapters later, Paul describes,

>(1 Corinthians 6:19–20 NIV11-GK) Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.

Paul describes in his letter to the Ephesians,

>(Ephesians 2:21–22 NIV11-GK) In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.

The first readers of Paul's letters would have understood the temple. They would have been able to quickly comprehend these verses. As we explore the temple in 1 Kings 6, we will deepen our grasp of this important structure in the story of God. In doing so, we will be able to live into God's story today. We will be able to fully appreciate Paul's description of our bodies as the temple of God.

Join us on Sunday as we study 1 Kings 6:1-7:1 together.
