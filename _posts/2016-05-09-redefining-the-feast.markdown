This Sunday (May 15) is Pentecost Sunday, the celebration of what happens in Acts 2. The Holy Spirit descends and the church is born. The scene is dramatic and powerful; wind, fire, multiple languages are all a part of the mix. Peter stands and proclaims how Jesus fits into the story of God. He quotes scripture from the Old Testament explaining how it all relates. He sums it up,

>(Acts 2:36 NIV) “Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.”

The response is intense. People are asking questions and are ready to respond.

>(Acts 2:37 NIV) When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”

They are instructed to *repent* and *be baptized*. In turn, the Holy Spirit will come on them and empower them. The church grows from about 120 followers to over 3000 in one day. 

Join us on Sunday as we explore Pentecost. We (as a non-Jewish people) might not understand the connection with the Jewish feast being celebrated at the time in Jerusalem. The Jewish Passover and the Feast of Pentecost (both 50 days apart) have powerful implications for the work of God in Acts 2. This past Sunday, we discussed how Jesus connected his work with God's story throughout all of history. His words are described in Luke 24.

>(Luke 24:27 NIV) And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.

At Pentecost, we watch as God's story takes a new direction. From the Jewish festival of Passover and the Feast of Pentecost, God reveals a new Passover (the blood of Jesus for the forgiveness of sins) and a new Pentecost (the coming of the Holy Spirit) for his people. I hope your schedule will allow you to worship with us on Sunday.
