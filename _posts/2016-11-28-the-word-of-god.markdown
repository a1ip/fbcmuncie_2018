As we step into the season of Advent, we have been encouraged to *wake up* to all that God is doing our world. The season leads us toward a posture of anticipation. This week we turn our attention to source of our expectancy, God's Word.

Paul writes to the church at Rome,

>(Romans 15:4 NIV) For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope.

The word *hope* abounds during the holiday season. But what is the basis for this hope? Our hope is _not_ a fairy tale; is is more than a myth. It is rooted in God's story which began before time and space. This story includes the birth, the life, the ministry, the death and resurrection of Jesus. God's story is recorded for us in His Word. 

This week, we reflect on the importance and centrality of God's Word. Join us as we explore Romans 15:4-13 together. As it is also the first Sunday of the month, we will also come to the Lord's Table together. See you on Sunday.

Note: As you plan your holiday schedule you might make note that we will gather at 7 PM for a special candlelight/communion service on Christmas Eve, for a combined worship service at 11 AM on Sunday, December 25 and a combined service at 11 AM on Sunday, January 1.
