Money can be an awkward topic. You loan a friend a few dollars; he forgets to pay you back. Do you bring it up? You are out to eat and the waiter brings the check. What do you say? Whenever a situation involves money, it gets uncomfortable fast. Yet the bible has no qualms bringing up the subject; Solomon has plenty to say on the matter.

Join us this week as we talk about the subject of money in the book of Proverbs. These past few sermons (on topics from Proverbs) have been incredibly practical. We have discussed words, anger and now we move to our finances. We continue to trust the value of wisdom in these everyday areas of our lives.

>(Proverbs 4:6-7 NIV) Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you. The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding.
