We have been walking through Matthew 5 for the last several weeks. We come again this week to this challenging chapter. Jesus' message does not get easier. In fact, as we continue, we find the application of this chapter increasing in difficulty. In the later part of last week's text (verses 17-20), Jesus highlights the unlikelihood of attaining salvation through the law.

>(Matthew 5:20 NIV) For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.

As we pick up this week in verse 21, Jesus expounds on this idea. As we delve into this week's text (Matthew 5:21-37), we find the bar rising. By the time we get a couple of verses in, we might be ready to give up. Jesus speaks of gouging out eyes and cutting off hands. Before you decide to skip church this week, let me assure you that we are _not_ setting up amputation stations in the lower auditorium. 

So what did Jesus intend for us in this teaching? How can we obey this teaching in our day and time? Join us on Sunday as we explore this text together. Let me to encourage you to read Matthew 5:21-37 and ask God to open your heart to this teaching as you prepare for worship on Sunday.
