This has been an intriguing study over the Ten Commandments. This week, we come to our final sermon of the series. For me, I have discovered a depth to the commandments that goes beyond a list of rules. When we peer deep into God’s intention behind each commandment, we see a God-oriented way of life charted out for us. 

We come this week to the final commandment. This is a crucial piece to how God desires us to live. I am eager to preach this week’s sermon. It is particularly relevant to our world today. Hope to see you on Sunday.

>(Exodus 20:17 ESV) “You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.”
