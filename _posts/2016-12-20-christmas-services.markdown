Throughout the season of Advent, we have been anticipating the coming of Jesus, the coming of Christmas. We are almost there. On Saturday, we will gather at **7 PM** for a **Christmas Eve** Candlelight/Communion service. As we light the final candle (the white candle), we proclaim together *Christmas is here!*. John 1 describes the profound mystery of God coming in the flesh. John, a close friend and disciple of Jesus, describes his experience.

>(John 1:1 NIV) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

He understands Jesus as the Word of God. He continues,

>(John 1:2-5 NIV) He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

And then down in verse 14, John describes Christmas.

>(John 1:14 NIV) The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. 

God, who existed in the very beginning, became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We will focus on this passage and come to Lord's table together. It is a beautiful way to begin Christmas. 

Then on Sunday, **Christmas Day**, we will gather again at **11 AM** for a family friendly worship service. We will consider Isaiah 9:2-7; the prophet expresses God's plan hundreds of years before it happens. Isaiah predicts the work of Jesus. 

Join us for worship on Christmas Eve and/or Christmas Day as we remember and celebrate the coming of Jesus.
