The season of Advent is moving along; we are only two weeks from Christmas Day. I have enjoyed working through the lectionary texts in Isaiah over the past few weeks. We come this week to a third text from the prophet. I hope you will take few minutes to read this text as you prepare for worship. 

>(Isaiah 61:8-11 NIV) “For I, the Lord, love justice; I hate robbery and wrongdoing. In my faithfulness I will reward my people and make an everlasting covenant with them. Their descendants will be known among the nations and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a people the Lord has blessed.” I delight greatly in the Lord; my soul rejoices in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of his righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. For as the soil makes the sprout come up and a garden causes seeds to grow, so the Sovereign Lord will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations.

The children will also be singing in worship in both services this week. See you on Sunday.
