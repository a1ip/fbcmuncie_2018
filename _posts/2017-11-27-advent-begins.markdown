With Thanksgiving and Black Friday in the past, Christmas seems only a short time away. Most are frantically working to make sure that everything is in place. It is a season of anticipation. 

Sunday begins the season of Advent. Advent is about looking forward. Like a child visualizing Christmas morning, Advent is a time where we await the movement of God in our world. The people of God had been looking for the coming Messiah for hundreds of years before Jesus showed up. This Advent season, we will be reflecting on the words of the prophet Isaiah. We will contemplate together the significance of Jesus' arrival. 

Join us on Sunday as we begin the season of Advent. We will be reflecting on Isaiah 64:1-9 together. Let me encourage you to read it ahead of time.

>(Isaiah 64:1-9 NIV) Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains would tremble before you! As when fire sets twigs ablaze and causes water to boil, come down to make your name known to your enemies and cause the nations to quake before you! For when you did awesome things that we did not expect, you came down, and the mountains trembled before you. Since ancient times no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who acts on behalf of those who wait for him. You come to the help of those who gladly do right, who remember your ways. But when we continued to sin against them, you were angry. How then can we be saved? All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away. No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us and have given us over to our sins. Yet you, Lord, are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand. Do not be angry beyond measure, Lord; do not remember our sins forever. Oh, look on us, we pray, for we are all your people.
