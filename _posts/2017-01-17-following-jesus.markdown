To be a follower is often seen in a negative light. Everyone wants to be a leader, a trail blazer. Yet as we consider our relationship to God, the posture of following is essential.

In this week's text, we will consider the early disciples of Jesus. In Matthew 4:12-23, Jesus leaves his hometown and begins his ministry. Almost immediately, he invites others to join in His mission. 

>(Matthew 4:18-20 NIV) As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.” At once they left their nets and followed him.

No hesitation on their part. They simply drop what they are doing and follow Jesus. Just a few verses later,

>(Matthew 4:21-22 NIV) Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.

Join us on Sunday as we explore this text. May our response be similar when God calls us. May we be willing to go where he leads and respond with similar abandon.
