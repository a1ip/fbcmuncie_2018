Have you ever dreamed of dropping it all and taking off? Perhaps you envision a life with no accountability. Can you imagine? No one to tell you what to do, where to go or how to behave. Thoughts of this life have at least passed through each of our minds at some point in time. Proverbs describes this freedom-seeking mode. These types are called the *simple*. They do not want to think deeply or be accountable to anyone. They want to do whatever they want, whenever they want. They love life with no rules.

This sort of dynamic is glamorized in our culture today. Simple, carefree rebels are idealized and celebrated in 2016. But what does the book of Proverbs say about such people?

In this week's text, wisdom calls out to the simple. 

>(Proverbs 1:22 NIV) “How long will you who are simple love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?

Wisdom pleads with the one who rejects her. She warns of the coming consequences of the one who rejects accountability. 

>(Proverbs 1:32-33 NIV) For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them; but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm.”

Join us on Sunday as we explore Proverbs 1:20-33. Freedom seems, at first glance, a starry-eyed state of utopia. Yet in the end, the rejection of wisdom results in destruction.
