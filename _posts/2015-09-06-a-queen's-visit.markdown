The time is closing on our completion of the Solomon series; we have four more weeks. In this week's text, we will venture into one of the most widespread legends in ancient history. While the bible offers one account, there are many versions throughout Islamic, Coptic and Ethiopian literature. The story involves the Queen of Sheba's visit to King Solomon.

We will not detail every version of the story. Both the Discovery Channel and the History Channel have explored the story in detail. Rather we will focus on the account in 1 Kings 10. The story in 1 Kings highlights the vast resources and the impressive abilities of King Solomon. The foreign queen is dazzled by Solomon. In turn she credits God for His provision and empowerment.

As we explore the story on Sunday, we will find unanswered questions concerning her origins and he extent of her relationship with Solomon. If you enjoy a good story, you will find the text intriguing. Join us on Sunday as we study 1 Kings 9:26-10:29 together.
