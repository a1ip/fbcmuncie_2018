It is sometimes a challenge to know what to study as a congregation. We try to keep a healthy balance between Old Testament and New Testament. We have typically been following the lectionary from Advent through Easter. Some years, we have stuck it out through Pentecost. Typically from Spring through the Fall, we have worked through various books of the Bible. We have covered Hebrews, Galatians, Acts, Joel, 1 Corinthians, Genesis, Ephesians, Ruth. This year, we have spent a good portion of the year in the life of David (primarily 1 and 2 Samuel). I have found the study invigorating and challenging. 

As we move into October, we conclude our series over the life of David. The last sermon in this series is October 5. This means it is time for something new. We have 7 weeks until we begin Advent. What are we going to do?

We are going to begin a seven week study on the book of James. You might already know that James is the half-brother of Jesus. He did not believe in Jesus until after Jesus' resurrection. However, once he saw the resurrected Jesus, he was passionate about his faith. He soon became a primary leader in the early church. The book of James is perhaps the earliest book of the Bible. It was written just a few years after Jesus' death and resurrection (around 45 A.D.). His words to the early church are practical and to the point. As we prepare to engage the book of James together, allow me to challenge you to read ahead. May God continue to equip us to be the people he has called us to be as we study His Word together each week.
