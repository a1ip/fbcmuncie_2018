We have heard the stories of Jesus over and over. From the feeding of the five thousand to walking on the water, many of us who grew up in Sunday school are familiar with the details. But too often, we isolate these stories from the rest of the gospel writer's account. As we continue through Mark's gospel, we are able to see these stories in the overall flow of Mark's story. Jesus does not perform miracles to seek attention or even to draw large crowds. His primary purpose is to prove his identity as Messiah. 

This week, we come to another series of miracles. Jesus, once again, reveals his power over the forces of nature. But his purpose is to reveal that he is God. I hope you will join us on Sunday as we continue the story of Jesus as Mark records it. This week, we will be in Mark 6:7-8:26. I hope you will read ahead as you prepare for worship.
