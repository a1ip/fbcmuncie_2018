David's pain at this point in his life is unspeakable. He has watched his family splinter into a band of self-seeking, morally corrupt children of the king. His palace has witnessed rape, murder, hatred. All the while, David seems to do little about it. By the time we get to 2 Samuel 14, David is not only suffering from a fractured family, he also has crumbling kingdom. The stage is set for another low point in David's life.

David's son, Absalom, is back in town and secretly undermining his father. In time, he leads a revolt. David is on the run for his life. On Sunday, we will explore 2 Samuel 14-19. A heart-broken king is heading out of town. Along the way, God provides friends for David. Each one plays a different role. We will walk through the story together on Sunday.

As we study this text, we are challenged in our relationships. Join us as consider David's friends.
