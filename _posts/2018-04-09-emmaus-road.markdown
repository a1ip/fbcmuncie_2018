The Easter season is a wonderful season; it actually goes from Resurrection Sunday to Pentecost Sunday (50 days later). It is time in which we are focusing on the resurrection of Jesus. Each week, we will come to a new story about the risen Christ. This week's passage is one of my favorite, Luke 24:13-35. We find two Jesus followers on their way to the town of Emmaus. They are joined by a mysterious traveler who we know to be Jesus. Unaware of his identity they talk with him about the events of the crucifixion and rumors of the resurrection. Jesus, unknown to them, chastises their lack of faith and explains how the events are the fulfillment of God's plan. Over the evening meal, Jesus makes himself known just before disappearing. They are overwhelmed by this experience and make their way back to Jerusalem to join the other followers.

I hope to see you on Sunday as we explore this fascinating story. You might read Luke 24:13-35 ahead of time as you prepare for worship.
